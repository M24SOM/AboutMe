    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks. \n\nI love fish. \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean. InFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river. \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much. \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing. \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something. \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands. \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium. In You should ask someone else about fishing, though. In\n</string>
